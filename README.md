jsDelivr bot
=============

The bot which validates and comments on PRs, squashs commits and merges submissions.

### Why

Couple reasons: we wanted something even faster than **@jimaek** (he usually took a about a minute whereas the bot is under a second), bigger than **@jimaek** (checks more things than a human can), better than **@jimaek** (can squash commits before merging), and stronger than **@jimaek** (will ask mods for help if unsure)

#### Why not travis/jenkins etc

Could of be done, but it would have been slower to validate and be difficult to support issue comment hooks (actions when a mod wants a pr squashed) and auto merging.

### How

Born out of a drunk weekend adventure to replace **@jimaek** with the github API, github3.py, and the jsDelivr API

### Usage

Note: squashing requires [`git-extras`](https://github.com/tj/git-extras)

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run server on port 9000
```sh
./run.py
```

```sh
./cli <pull-request-number>
```

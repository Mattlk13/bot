# Simple revalidation service to check pull requests which a) haven't been checked
# b) were by a trusted user. This is necessary as sometimes an error will cause part of
# the validation process to not occur. For example, if we attempt to merge to prs too
# quickly, github will reject the second merge as the ref may be out of date (#63).
